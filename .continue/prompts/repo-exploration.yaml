    description: Repo Exploration to update Codebase Memory
    prompt: |
      You are tasked with filling in this section of the root level README will a bullet list.
      You should achieve this by first doing some exploration to understand the repo.

      You should use taskmaster-ai tools to create, manage and execute tasks, that will let you achieve this exploration.

      During your exploration be attentive and identify any new information was gathered during the interaction, using it to update your memory knowledge graph using the Codebase Memory tool as follows:
      1 Create entities
      2 Connect them to the current entities using relations
      3 Store facts about them as observations

      If at any point you need to clarify something it is **extremely** important you ask the user.

      # Definitions
      ## Entities
      Some examples of the type of entities this codebase :
      * files
      * directories
      * classes
      * objects
      * scripts
      * to-do items
      * processes
      And more that you might decide.

      ## Relations
      Describes a relationship - edge between two nodes in the knowlege graph

      ## Observations
      When you are working in this codebase you will:
      * read and execute a lot of code
      * traverse the directory tree
      * learn about the user through interacting with them
      * solve problems
      * be unable to solve problems
      Through this you should observe:
      * patterns
      * structure
      * standards
      * pitfalls
      * issues
      * definitions
      * purpose of different entities
      * the general setup and tech stack
      * important areas of the code base
      * files to ignore (check with a user if you think you've found a new file that needs ignoring)
