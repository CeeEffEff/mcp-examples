      # Prerequisites
      In order to perform this task:
      * We must have interacted or you must have interacted with the codebase.
      * You have access to the Codebase Memory tool.
      If you don't meet the prerequisites return an explanation to the user.

      # Task
      Please reflect on the chat history and any new information was gathered during the interaction
      update your memory knowledge graph using the Codebase Memory tool as follows:
      1 Create entities
      2 Connect them to the current entities using relations
      3 Store facts about them as observations

      If at any point you need to clarify something it is **extremely** important you ask the user.

      # Considerations
      To be extra safe, you should make sure any string attribute of an object you give to a tool as an argument has
      any special characters removed.
      These may be special characters in other languages to the one you are using.
      

      # Definitions
      ## Entities
      Some examples of the type of entities this codebase :
      * files
      * directories
      * classes
      * objects
      * scripts
      * to-do items
      * processes

      And more that you might decide.

      ## Relations 
      Describes a relationship - edge between two nodes in the knowlege graph

      ## Observations
      When you are working in this codebase you will:
      * read and execute a lot of code
      * traverse the directory tree
      * learn about the user through interacting with them
      * solve problems
      * be unable to solve problems

      Through this you should observe:
      * patterns
      * structure
      * standards
      * pitfalls
      * issues
      * definitions
      * purpose of different entities
      * the general setup and tech stack
      * important areas of the code base
      * files to ignore (check with a user if you think you've found a new file that needs ignoring)
