      Primary task:
        Update the repository knowledge graph until we have 100% coverage.
        You will use the the Memory MCP Memory server for this.

        If you need to understand how the repo compares, you can do an ls tool.

      Secondary task:
        After every 3 updates to the Memory MCP Memory knowledge graph:

          1. evaluate the correctness of these 3 additions

          2. update the rule represent-repositories-in-memory-mcp-kg.md based off of the correctness of recent additions

          3. Clear your context window

        Then you can return to your Primary task.
