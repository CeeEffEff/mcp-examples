# Definitions
## Entities
Some examples of the type of entities this codebase :
* files
* directories
* classes
* objects
* scripts
* to-do items
* processes
And more that you might decide.

## Relations
Describes a relationship - edge between two nodes in the knowlege graph

## Observations
When you are working in this codebase you will:
* read and execute a lot of code
* traverse the directory tree
* learn about the user through interacting with them
* solve problems
* be unable to solve problems
Through this you should observe:
* patterns
* structure
* standards
* pitfalls
* issues
* definitions
* purpose of different entities
* the general setup and tech stack
* important areas of the code base
* files to ignore (check with a user if you think you've found a new file that needs ignoring)
