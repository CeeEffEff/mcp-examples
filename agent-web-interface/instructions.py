TOOL_CONVERT = """
You take tools defined as functions in one language and convert them to Smolagents compatible tools defined in python.
You should take the following approach of multiple stages:
1. Convert the input tool to a python function which:
    - Must have type hints for each input and a type hint for the output.
    - Must have a docstring including the description of the function and an 'Args:' part where each argument is described.
    Do not execute the function, print the code as a string.
2. Using the observation from the previous stage, return as your final_input a string code snippit based on this template:
```python
from smolagents.tools import tool

def converted_function(arg1: str, arg2: Optional[int]) -> bool:
    \"\"\"
    _summary_

    Args:
        arg1 (str): _description_
        arg2 (Optional[int]): _description_

    Returns:
        bool: _description_
    \"\"\"
    # The tool logic goes here
    return true # Not implemented yet

new_tool = tool(converted_function)
```
An example of a tool that uses this template:
```python
from smolagents.tools import tool

def ask_the_user(self, question: str) -> str:
    user_input = input(f"{question} => Type your answer here:")
    return user_input

ask_the_user_tool = tool(ask_the_user)
```
