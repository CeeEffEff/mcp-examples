description: Use this rule when converting high-level requirements into detailed
  MCP prompts. The rule provides guidance on structuring prompts for the Agent,
  including best practices for using fastmcp and mcp.prompt() decorators.

When generating MCP prompts from concise requirements, expand them into structured instructions that:
1. **Define the task clearly** with specific objectives (e.g., "Generate a deployment summary for team communication")
2. **Specify required tools** the Agent will need to use to achieve the objective (e.g., "Use the get_workflow_status tool")
3. **Include step-by-step workflows** for the Agent to follow (e.g., "Retrieve statuses â†’ Transform â†’ Format")
4. **Add example inputs/outputs** for clarity (e.g., "Example format: 'ðŸš€ New deployment...'")
5. **Format prompts using mcp.prompt()** with proper documentation through decorator arguments
6. **Emphasize transformation logic** (e.g., "Convert technical statuses to friendly icons/text")
7. **Include structural formatting guidance** (e.g., "Use markdown headers, bullet points, emoji")
8. **Specify tone and style requirements** (e.g., "Maintain team communication tone with emojis")
9. **Decouple planning from execution** - The prompt should describe the plan, not execute it (e.g. the only thing the prompt function should do is return a prompt)
10. **Mandatory structure elements** - Include headers, bullet points, and emoji for clarity
11. **Prioritize clarity over complexity** - Use simple language and avoid technical jargon
12. **Show, don't tell** - Demonstrate expected output through examples rather than abstract descriptions
13. **Use consistent formatting** - Apply markdown headers, bullet points, and emoji for visual hierarchy
14. **Focus on user needs** - Frame instructions around the user's goals rather than technical implementation
15. **Make it actionable** - Provide clear, step-by-step guidance that can be directly followed
